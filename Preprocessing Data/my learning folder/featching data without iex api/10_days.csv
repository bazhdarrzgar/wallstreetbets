y43tsm,None,N/A,credit cards to $ in realized profit to $ loss in weeks,YOLO,1,1.0,New-Biscotti-4662,0,ampxb in early march a close friend began messaging me about masks and the insanity of the marketplace busy dealing with our day to day and the world falling apart around us we were not ready to gamble away what i didnt have on masks which i knew nothing about in a market that was nothing less than a ticking time bomb waiting to implode obviously as the days passed and new york began to see the effects of the virus did we soon realize what we should have done two week prior during the same time a current supplier of ours in our typical business began reaching out to us regarding being able to offer kn masks considering weve been doing business with them already and they are a publicly traded company on the honk kong stock exchange we felt much more comfortable placing an order knowing it would be delivered as promised as during those times it was simply impossible to get masks we heard stories of buyers showing up to factories with bags of cash buying at higher prices than current orders in order to jump the lines it was complete chaos not only in the manufacturing but simply every aspect of assuring the masks would arrive in our warehouse in ny countries were locked down flights were halted international travel suspended the world came to a stop and somehow we had to ensure these masks got halfway around the world before the market was flooded and the market would inevitably collapse considering we were not ready to get involved with every chat and broker to get these masks sold we gave our friend who introduced us to the masks fiasco the job of selling them so before placing the order we sent out some feelers to get a little more comfortable the factory wanted $ per mask and i still needed to air freight them which cost approximately $ each for customs local trucking and warehousing at that point we felt comfortable the market was at $$ and wasnt losing steam even though we very well knew the factory was way overcharging as weve been quoted the same exact product a few months prior for only $ we had no issue going ahead knowing there was no room for negotiations as they would simply sell it to the next buyers in line and that simply having the opportunity to purchase masks from a trustworthy source that would actually deliver was very hard to find mid march we placed our first order for as a test to see the process and make sure we can do this on a larger scale with sourcing in place and the masks to be ready within days we started to work on customs clearance and shipping we contacted our freight forwarder to make sure i knew i had someone i can personally call and talk to day or night to ensure this was being handled with all hands on deck the first order was smooth sailing from hong kong customs to us delivery‚Ä¶ the only hiccup along the way was our parting with of the masks as we partnered with our freight forwarder and his friend before the flight in order to once again mitigate our risks as this was only our first shipment as a test and having our forwarder on board would ensure the masks got through customs on both ends and delivered as they should be since he now also had skin in the game before taking off our forwarder and his friend came in on the purchase and gave credit cards to charge their buyins as we didnt have the cash to put such a deal together to purchase masks from there on out we worked together on getting these masks sold at one point we all decided we wanted to sell it to our own customers and not sell it as a whole as we likely couldnt agree on price as we were looking to get out before we got in so we were willing to take less than most as we were looking to test the market and make a meaningful move if this first shipment proved fruitful the night the masks arrived they were sold $ each without even blinking an eye we placed an additional order for masks this was the game changer by this point taking cargo space on typical air freight wasnt an option flights were extremely difficult to charter as countries werent allowing international travel due to the spread of the virus which therefore limited any available aircraft or possible flights luckily enough we managed to book a flight from hkg to mem we specifically sent the flight to mem as we had a contact at the airport that weve charted a previous flight for a few years prior so we knew if he was able to handle the shit show we rained on him then that he would be the guy to make it happen now and boy were we right thank god so at this point we were no millionaires‚Ä¶ and neither did these masks make us‚Ä¶ well at least not for the long run we didnt have $ for the charter or the $ for the masks we used credit cards just to scrap together importing masks someway somehow by the will of god we scraped together the full charter cost and the necessary deposit to convince the factory to ship as this was truly a time of urgency and we had extreme faith the moment we had these on the ground we would have a wire in our bank account and would be able to send the full balance within days it went like this beautifully‚Ä¶ until it all came crashing down the factory had ensured we got every last mask delivered in time and paid special fees to ensure the flight didnt leave empty without the funds to make this happen we were being threatened the flight was getting canceled as we only managed to send the funds in the final hour the goods nearly missed the flight as the hong kong airport was a zoo and flights cant wait around but will fly without your cargo as im the charting company and the flight path is ours and we can choose to load the flight or not‚Ä¶ but if our goods dont reach the airport in time or get held up at customs or need to be repacked and your running against the clock‚Ä¶ the plane will leave empty truthfully the first flight flew at capacity of what an md could carry because we were not looking to bring in more than masks so we did what we had to and chartered what we could get our hands on at these times the state dept began confiscating flight paths and aircraft after private companies would finish the legwork of setting them in place so we would book a set up a flight path confirm landings and authorizations and a few hours later we would get an email that the flight was taken by the state dept and we should look elsewhere for another aircraft to handle our cargo and once they took a jet they werent giving it back till they were done which is the reason our proceeding charters were a russian cargo jet and passenger airliners so the risks were now not only actually being able to get ahold of masks through customs and on a plane but the very real possibility of being lucky enough to have everything lined up and and ready to load onto the aircraft only to be held up by the us state dept taking over your charter and flight path this would leave you with ready cargo and no possibility of another charter for another minimum of days due to the amount of cargo congestion and flight path request restrictions due to covid after sweating over the honk kong side of the customs and loading which happened over a sabbath we had a beautiful arrival in memphis we chartered a small private jet to get us from ny to mem to ensure things went as needed theres nothing like being on the ground making a decision then and there to get something done being there enabled us to get two wheelers on the tarmac at memphis we loaded the airline pallets from the plane directly onto the trucks from there it was straight to ny with gps trackers following the route and a multimilliondollar insurance policy on the cargo delivered or not were set to make money these masks were sold as follows and brought in a profit of $ at $ went to the same buyer as our first as i needed to fulfill a pc order went the same the buyer as the first at $ went to the city of new york at $ went to leon amp saitel for $ and he was ready to buy in excess of units the first orders went without a hiccup with the same brokers involved we had sqft warehouse in upstate ny that we setup to unload airline pallets and repack to standard pallets we had an a rated warehouse with security and worked around the clock to unload repack and ship out as quickly as possible the third order of units to the city of new york materialized when we reached out to an earlier contact whom a sale never materialized but had responded this time when we reached out we sent a follow up email to the thread which never materialized stating my masks just passed an n test proving their filtration ratings and that we currently had units in our warehouse within minutes he replied well take them all from there we needed to get it to an actual purchase order hesitant to make an outright purchase of millions of dollars from a stranger for the the city of new york would be a strange thing‚Ä¶ but then again these were strange times nevertheless we had to start from somewhere we went over the masks and their testing and my relationship with the factory and how we were the actual importer flying in the product directly from the manufacturer and not a reseller like the hundreds of others theyve been fielding the next step was getting a sample in their hands we drove to downtown manhattan in about minutes which would have taken during typical times an hour and a half but during the height of the lockdowns the streets were absolutely empty you could walk through the streets without seeing another person or car new york was a ghost town making my way to the address we found my contact in the lobby of their building behind locked glass doors for ‚Äòsafety with everyones masks on we slowly left our box of samples at the door and got back into our car we purposely brought a full case pack so they can see how it comes packed and the exact product i had available for them arriving on a chartered flight that day still questioning my authenticity the buyer asked how he could know if we actually had the product on hand or if he was issuing another purchase order that would go unfulfilled just like the hundreds of other sellers before me jokingly we told him we left you a box of samples we couldve sold it for $ that day if we werent serious about what we were offering from the email in the morning to the samples dropped off we were at in the afternoon by pm the buyer was persuaded to send us a letter of intent as we didnt want to risk warehousing millions of dollars in masks a minute longer than we needed to we told him we needed the trucks to be parked at his facility overnight and we would offload as soon as they opened as eager as we were to sell the city the masks we were concerned about how long payments could take as getting set up as a vendor and issuing millions of dollars in payments to random companies we assumed wouldnt happen overnight and this would kill the entire cash flow of the entire operation nevertheless we went ahead and parked our trucks outside dcas warehouses in queens and slept in our car beside the trucks till they opened and offloaded us that same day we were setup as a city of new york vendor and issued a purchase order for the full masks and days later wired the full payment the fourth order for went to a buyer looking to get as many masks as he could get his hands on and at the highest price we sold unfortunately we only currently had left never met the person or even spoke to them directly but was the smoothest and simplest transaction during this entire fiasco this far we were ready to bring in another plane just knowing we had this buyer and how quickly the masks were sold and thats exactly what we did everything we imported till now was in and out of our warehouse within hours the total cash required to put this deal together was $ with an additional $ credit line from the factory and $ cash advance bringing the total to $ the deal costs were $ for the masks $ for the airplane charter hkg to mem $ charter from ny to mem $ duties $ trucking mem to ny $ hkg cargo terminal $ sale commission $ sale commission $ mem cargo terminal $ cash advance cost total costs $ second round masks total sales $ total costs $ total profit $ once the money started coming in we immediately placed the next order and began working on flights this order however rather than using the typical supplier we used another source we had in china that was guaranteeing deliveries and quantities in the required timelines of asap and also the timing happened to correspond with the jewish holidays and our relationship ensured the cargo would be loaded and shipped regardless of my involvement in the china side as with the other supplier both sides in china and the us had to be managed once we decided to take the gamble we quickly amassed an order of masks and isolation gowns and had them loaded onto a russian chartered il bringing a quick total purchase and import cost of cash required to bring the deal together we needed $ so obviously we took all that quick cash we just landed and doubled down‚Ä¶ as we said ‚Äúlets roll the dice‚Äù using the initial investment and the $ in profit from the last import we were able to financially roll the deal into this purchase charter and import all while still negotiating sales of the previous merchandise and quickly turning our quick and i would say very hard earned cash into our next investment as we now had a significant amount of capital to make a real significant return and so we thought the same thing when we bought the next masks what could only be considered comical is what we would later find out about the russian airlines request for landing rights had been a doctored letter from our company as the importer of very urgently required medical grade masks we signed a letter for them as requested on our letterhead‚Ä¶ not the letter submitted which i was forwarded on an email chain including dept homeland security fema us air force dept of transportation custom and border protection since they were all seemingly frantically trying to figure out whos cargo clearly marked as masks and isolation gowns was being flown in and nevertheless to a tiny airport in upstate new york with a russian chartered cargo jet this all happened over what was a three day jewish holiday we ended the holiday to the panic of sifting through emails and whats app and wechat messages and groups to see what the flights final fate had been as we knew all the uncertainty of every aspect of the task of getting this product from china and into the us and our possession the process and time was what made having the product so quickly invaluable at the time one small mistake anywhere along the lines of production packing local trucking customs repacking for the airline could jeopardize not making the cargo loading cutoff times never would we have thought of the fiasco that was created by this charter without our not answering during the holiday it only created a larger microscope to be pointing on this flight and its cargo considering the size of the airport their cbp office is supposed to be informed in advance for a team to be brought from newark to inspect as this airport doesnt typically have international cargo flights as we were later told without any prior notice before landing upon arrival a team of cbp members were called in from newark as well as two fbi agents who were looking through the cargo to only ask about the images of the rabbis we had posted on all of the pallets to watch over the safe travels of our cargo as we prayed at their gravesite every night with thank god everything running smoothly we now had our next million masks in our possession and ready to sell we simply had to reach back out to our last buyer who bought at $ and sell him the next the deal was done within days of landing we had them repacked and shipped out to someone we could be sitting right next to and would never know it the wire was in and the sale completed another masks sold for $ dollars the total cash required to put this deal together was $ with an additional $ credit line from the factory and $ cash advance bringing the total to $ the deal costs were $ for the masks and gowns $ for the airplane charter pvg to swf $ duties $ sale commission $ cash advance cost total costs $ third round masks isolation gowns total sales $ total donations gowns to the city of new york total costs $ total profit $ total cumulative profits from the first second and third imports were now $ import profit $ import profit $ import profit $ total profit $ so what did we do‚Ä¶ what i guess no one in our position would do we rolled the dice again only this time at the big boys table‚Ä¶ because we thought we were big boys before with the rate the market ate whatever we could import bringing in however many we could in the shortest amount of time to try and mitigate risks was our best bet how could we lose we just made $ in a few weeks time we didnt think we could lose‚Ä¶ until the government stepped in we were set we now had millions and a plan we ordered masks to be chartered on dreamliners filling the cargo hulls to max capacity on consecutive flights to coordinate production timing and flight capacity we never thought we would have to think about a mask a charter customs trucking sales brokers and resellers or even a day job for that matter we just needed to get these flights imported and sold we would be set at the low end of the spectrum if the market started getting soft and we needed to sell quickly we were projected to profit easily another $‚Ä¶ so in the worst case all we needed to really do was significantly undercut the market and only make another $ we thought‚Ä¶ boy were we wrong turns out we would lose $ which would be the total profit accumulated till then and a $ balance to the publicly traded hong kong company producing the masks for us during this time the us government started putting together what they called an appendix a of whitelisted companies from china who had ‚Äòcertified masks knowing our masks were the real deal this wouldnt be a problem for us we hired fda lawyers had countless labs test done on our masks only to continuously get pushed day by day to a never ending possibility of actually getting listed on the appendix a which would only be updated every week and holding onto the masks every day longer as the market would inevitably crumble and quickly fueled by the governments interference made them worth less and less every day until they would actually become worthless during some of our darkest days we actually contemplated burning down the warehouse we stored them in to collect the insurance but obviously would never bring ourselves to do such a thing at this time we had every last cent of profit we made reinvested plus

of what happens in markets is driven by pure stupidity or rather inattention misinformation about fundamentals and an exaggerated focus on currently circulating stories robert shiller a major boom in

instead of trying to be very intelligent charlie munger it takes a man a long time to learn all the lessons of all of his mistakes they say there are two sides to everything but there is only one side

doesnt even wish to have to think jesse lauriston livermore it would be silly to expect every bear market to turn into the great depression it would be equally wrong to expect that a fall from overvalued to more fairly valued couldnt badly overshoot on the downside seth klarman there is a considerable tendency for common stock investors to do the greater part of their buying both of ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù securities at high levels of the market they are equally inclined to do the greater part of their selling at low levels of the market a procedure which is not conducive to successful results benjamin graham it is only in a bear market that the value investing discipline becomes especially important because value investing virtually alone among strategies gives you exposure to the upside with limited downside risk seth klarman the novice soon learns that stocks are likely to maintain an upward or downward trend for long periods of time with minor interruptions

inflate the stock price of nikola a maker of electric trucks a federal jury on friday found trevor milton guilty of defrauding investors by lying about the supposed technical achievements of nikola the electric truck maker he founded mr milton was convicted of one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud the most serious of which carry a maximum prison sentence of years he was acquitted on an additional count of securities fraud the jury in us district court in manhattan delivered the verdict after about four weeks of testimony and about six hours of deliberation prosecutors portrayed mr milton as a serial fabricator who wooed investors by falsely claiming that nikola was close to producing longhaul trucks that could run emissionfree on cheap hydrogen ‚Äútrevor milton is a con man‚Äù jordan estes assistant us attorney said thursday as she summarized the governments case ‚Äúhe lied to investors to get their money plain and simple‚Äù defense attorneys argued that mr milton did not intend to defraud anybody and that his statements were not responsible for a plunge in nikolas stock price that wiped out billions of dollars in value marc mukasey a defense lawyer acknowledged that mr milton sometimes spoke in the present tense about things nikola hoped to achieve in the future ‚Äúhe loved nikola‚Äù mr mukasey told jurors on thursday likening mr milton to an overenthusiastic parent who brags about his child on friday mr mukasey said ‚Äúwe respect the verdict but were going to keep fighting‚Äù mr milton who had appeared cheerful during much of the trial shook his head in apparent disbelief after hearing the verdict his wife chelsey milton leaned her head against the back of a courtroom bench and sobbed us district judge edgardo ramos who presided over the trial allowed mr milton to remain free on a $ million bond until sentencing in january the case provided a lesson in the hazards of investing in fledgling ‚Äúprerevenue‚Äù electric vehicle makers that have ideas but limited or nonexistent sales with the exception of tesla new carmakers have struggled with manufacturing problems in a recent example rivian a maker of electric pickup trucks said last week that it was recalling almost all of the vehicles it has produced because a small number have an improperly tightened fastener that could cause the steering to malfunction the milton trial was also a was a test of prosecutors ability to hold managers of publicly traded companies accountable for statements they make on social media and other public forums that can cause share prices to gyrate mr milton was a prolific user of twitter and frequently appeared on podcasts and business news programs a college dropout with no formal training in engineering mr milton founded nikola in in the basement of his salt lake city home the company listed on nasdaq in by merging with a special purpose acquisition corporation or spac called vectoiq acquisition corporation vectoiq is managed by stephen girsky a former highranking executive at general motors the deal with the socalled blankcheck corporation allowed nikola to avoid some of the regulatory scrutiny usually applied to initial public offerings after the stock market listing made him wealthy mr milton who owned percent of nikola shares went on a spending spree buying luxuries including a gulfstream jet and a multimilliondollar home in the turks and caicos islands in about six months during according to testimony mr milton spent more than $ million nikola shares peaked near $ in june when the company was worth more than ford motor shortly after the investment firm hindenburg research issued a report accusing mr milton of making numerous false assertions about the companys technology pointing to a video in which a truck was rolled down an incline to make it look like a working prototype mr mukasey dismissed the video as mere ‚Äúspecial effects‚Äù ‚Äúits certainly not a crime to use special effects‚Äù mr mukasey told jurors ‚Äúotherwise the government would have to indict the energizer bunny‚Äù mr milton resigned as executive chairman a few weeks after the hindenburg report nikola shares closed friday at $ last year nikola agreed to pay a civil penalty of $ million settle a fraud investigation by the securities and exchange commission the company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement nikola aspired to be the tesla of the trucking industry ‚Äî both companies took their name from nikola tesla a pioneer in developing alternatingcurrent technology nikola planned to build trucks that would be powered by emissionfree hydrogen fuel cells the company would build a network of hydrogen fueling stations along major highways much as tesla built a network of charging stations during the trial prosecutors played video interviews in which mr milton claimed nikola was already producing ‚Äúgreen‚Äù hydrogen with renewable energy for less than the cost of diesel a major milestone ‚Äúgame is over for diesel‚Äù mr milton said on twitter in fact nikola had produced ‚Äúnot one molecule‚Äù of hydrogen ms estes said others in the fledgling green hydrogen industry are still struggling to produce the gas cheaply enough to undercut diesel mr milton also said he had billions of dollars in binding contracts with trucking companies to buy nikola vehicles the ‚Äúcontracts‚Äù were just reservations that could easily be canceled prosecutors contended among the witnesses was scott damman a senior manager at general motors which planned to build a batterypowered pickup truck the badger with nikola the announcement of the badger in february caused a spike in nikolas stock price mr damman testified that gm would have manufactured the truck and supplied all of the engineering and technology while nikola contributed some of the design and marketing nonetheless according to testimony mr milton said on twitter and other forums that nikola was responsible for ‚Äú percent‚Äù of the technology in the badger portraying gm as little more than a supporting player gm pulled out of the partnership soon after the hindenburg report and the badger was never produced other nikola executives including mark russell the chief executive and kim brady the chief financial officer warned mr milton repeatedly that his statements could backfire prosecutors contended the executives even staged an ‚Äúintervention‚Äù where they tried unsuccessfully to get mr milton to hew to the truth according to witnesses mr mukasey the defense lawyer pointed to internal nikola emails in which the executives praised mr miltons media appearances ‚Äúthey were telling trevor what a good job he was doing‚Äù mr mukasey said the convictions include a charge that mr milton defrauded a man who sold him a ranch in utah mr milton paid for the ranch in part with nikola stock options that proved to be worthless the acquittal on one of the securities fraud counts offered mr milton a bit of relief a conviction on that charge would have exposed him to a maximum sentence of years nikola based in phoenix continues to operate producing a limited number of batterypowered trucks in cooperation with established companies including iveco an italian truck maker that is manufacturing nikola vehicles in germany michael lohscheller an auto industry veteran who was previously the chief executive of the german carmaker opel was named president of nikola in august stefan hartung chief executive of the german electronics maker bosch said in an interview this month that he still believed in nikola bosch one of the worlds largest makers of components for the vehicle industry is supplying fuel cell technology for nikola

## My Weekly Plan For Project

* Week 1 - 2: My Data or Generate Raw Data

    - Reddit PRAW

    - PushShift API ( PSAW ) For Reddit Post

    - IEX Finance API

* Week 3 - 4: Data Preprocessing

    - Week 3: Clearning Data ( Filtering The Data )

        + Spart NLP ( Natural Language Processing )

    - Week 4: Sentiment Prediction ( Sentiment Analysis )

        + Visualize The Data Using Chart And Model And ...

* Week 5: Tools and Libraries

    - Pandas: A popular package combining simple-to-use data extraction utilities with powerful analytical tools
    and structures.
    
    - Numpy: An important reason for Pythonâ€™s ubiquity in the scientific community. Provides support for large
    multidimensional arrays and the mathematical computing power of more fundamental languages like C
    and Fortran.
    
    - Matplotlib: A data visualisation module that allows easily digestible plotting of Pandas Data Frames.
    
    - Plotly: Another data visualisation package that utilises JSON to plot interactive graphs online.
    
    - Seaborn: An extension of Matplotlib for advanced visualisation tools, such as combining graphs to
    produce an aggregate display of the data in the context of this report.
    
    - Scikit-learn: This package provides the machine learning models we will be using to classify posts as
    positive or negative. The library interacts closely with Numpy.
    
    - Re: This library is used to load the Regular Expressions to clean the text and other pre-processing needed.

    - Text2emotion: This package is used for classifying posts into 5 emotional states for our data exploration:
    Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, Anger and Fear.
